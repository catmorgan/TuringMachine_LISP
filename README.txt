Cat Morgan, Sept. 24, 2014, Turing Machine in LISP 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This assignment was for Artificial Intelligence, programmed in LISP, at 
Vassar College. The prompt was simply to implement a turing machine. 

One thing that I may do differently looking back, is instead of 
having the turing struct take in a tape to be processed, have the
turing struct contain each state that turing machine has. 

Such as, non-empty states, the alphabet, the blank symbol, the input symbols,
the initial state, the accepting states and the transition function so that 

Turing machine M = {Q, Gamma, b, Sigma, delta, q_0, F}
